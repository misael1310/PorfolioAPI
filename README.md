# PorfolioAPI

This repository is designed as a simple project, with plans for continuous improvement. It employs a basic Repository Pattern to separate database access from controllers, and as the project expands, a Service Layer will be added to further isolate business logic.

The project’s purpose is to populate my personal portfolio website with detailed information about each project I’ve completed. Though building it wasn’t strictly necessary, I thoroughly enjoyed the process.
